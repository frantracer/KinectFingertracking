# KinectFingertracking
This project explained step by step how to perform finger and hand tracking with the Kinect for XBOX with the official Kinect SDK.  Finger and hand tracking are included in the field of the human-computer interaction (HCI). The goal of this work is to describe a robust and efficient method to track the hand and the fingers in real time using the Kinect device, but taking into account the Kinect for XBOX limitations, like the lack of the NEAR MODE.  First of all the project is focused in develop a Windows application using only libraries and functions that XBOX supports. After the application will be ready, the second step of the project starts, to create a XBOX library with all the features we have designed.  The Kinect device allows us to obtain a depth image, instead of a normal RGB image, which gives us more information than a normal camera. These kind of images are more useful for the tracking, and moreover we can represent the relevant points in a 3D space. This device allows us to create immersive virtual environments applications or games.
